				Instead of simply seeing a green checkmark or a red "x" if you've answered a question correctly or not, you'll get real-time visual results. If you answer a question correctly, the styles being asked about in that particular question will be applied to the quiz. If you answer a question incorrectly, you'll be stuck with the browser's (often ugly) default styles.

				By the end of this quiz, you'll see exactly how well you know CSS.
